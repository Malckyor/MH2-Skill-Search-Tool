# MH2-Skill-Search-Tool
This is a Japanese tool that sadly I don't know who is the author, but I want to express all my gratitude for making this and he/she, whoever made this has all the credits aside from my English translations added here.

This is a tool to help making set mixes for Monster Hunter 2 DOS for the PS2, differently from my [MH2DOS-DAT-to-MHSX2G](https://github.com/Malckyor/MH2DOS-DAT-to-MHSX2G) this is a proper tool made for this unique game and so it works better than the other tool, but since I don't have the sources (I wouldn't be able to do much even if I had) I couldn't translate everything.

First I wanted to say that I couldn't translate 2 skills since they seem to be tied to some internal code, they are 胴系統倍加 (Torso Inc) and 防御 (Defense), you should know how they work so it's not a big deal, but I must say that it was not possible to translate the GUI... This is somewhat relevant, but it's a simple tool to use and it only requires a few clicks to fully understand it.

To make this work make sure you have Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or above.
Also since it's a Japanese tool the PC region **MUST** be Japanese, you can change that in the Control Panel. If the PC region is not Japanese it will throw an error and no, locale emulator does not work with it. If you see the skill names in English in the two boxes on the left then it's working.
No guides are provided by now and it's not fully translated, we shall wait for the [「BREAK ARTS」](https://twitter.com/AcuteAcid/status/1601316565240385539) translation.

***I'm only uploading the tool here for preservation and also sharing it with my English translation, if the author requests it to be removed it will be done and only my translations will be shared and a link for the tool will be linked here if the author shares any.***
